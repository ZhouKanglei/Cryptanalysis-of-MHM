# Cryptanalyzing an image encryption based on a modified Henon map using hybrid chaotic shift transform

Recently, a novel image encryption scheme has been proposed based on a modified Henon map using hybrid chaotic shift transform. This paper analyzes the security of the original encryption scheme and finds it insecure against the chosen-plaintext attack. Meanwhile, an efficient strategy is proposed to break the original encryption scheme with several chosen-plaintext attacks. The experimental results show that all the keys can be revealed with a time complexity of only O(⌈MNlogc⁡(MN)⌉). Furthermore, some improvement suggestions are proposed.

## Results

The validity of the proposed cryptanalysis: images from column 1 to column 6 show plain images, cipher images, images with the diffusion effect eliminated, retrieved permutation-only images, final restored images and the XOR results for column 1 and column 5.
