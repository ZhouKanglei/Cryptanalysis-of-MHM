# Cryptanalyzing an image encryption based on a modified Henon map using hybrid chaotic shift transform

Recently, a novel image encryption scheme has been proposed based on a modified Henon map using hybrid chaotic shift transform. This paper analyzes the security of the original encryption scheme and finds it insecure against the chosen-plaintext attack. Meanwhile, an efficient strategy is proposed to break the original encryption scheme with several chosen-plaintext attacks. The experimental results show that all the keys can be revealed with a time complexity of only O(⌈MNlogc⁡(MN)⌉). Furthermore, some improvement suggestions are proposed.
